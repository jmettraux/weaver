Elethorn GM has been going through his [Legend of Tsukikara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7sD0I-Fk5Q) (fr) solo play and one of his tools mesmerized me. I did not realize immediately that it was a card and it was simply labelled _Muses et Oracles_. I initially thought it was a more complex tool but it was a simple stack of cards.

I have the [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) application based on Brian Eno's cards on my phone, and "Each card contains a gnomic suggestion, aphorism or remark which can be used to break a deadlock or dilemma situation".

[Muses And Oracles](http://www.onirarts.com/Muses&Oracles/) is more content than strategy. I learned that they were selling the cards and I ordered them. I haven't used them yet, but I am sure they'll be more useful than my staring at [Tarot](20210607.html?f=Obliques_and_Oracles&t=Bosch_and_Tarot) cards or clicking my Oblique Strategies instance.

The cards are in French but can be ordered in [Germany](http://www.printerstudio.de/sell/LaBoutiqueOnirArts) or the [USA](http://www.printerstudio.com/sell/LaBoutiqueOnirArts). They come in five colour themes. There are 240 cards, they can be ordered as standard cards with a decorative card back, or recto-verso, so it cuts the stack to 120 cards.

The cards borders sport 10 **keywords**, the point you pick the card at is supposed to determine which keyword is selected. If that is impractical, simply roll 1d10. If I roll a 3 with the card on the right, then the keyword is "suffocation".

On top of the card, just above the 1 to 5 stars (1d5), is the **omen**. It's "Yes", "No", "Yes and...", "Yes but...", "No and...", or "No but...".

The **illustration** is pure visual suggestion. The guide suggests drawing three cards and weaving a story with the three illustrations.

The one to five **stars** may be used as a 1d5 or as a reaction roll. Left of the stars is the **direction** icon, wind direction, threat direction, ...

Below the stars are the **verbs**. The first of them is a more general verb, while the two others are more specific.

They are followed by **location**, **concept**, **object**, **weather** (with the small cloud). The small heart flags the **sentiment**, while the question mark signals the **disposition**.

Sentiment and dispostion can be used for NPCs, as well as the **apparence**, **motivation**, **traits**, **secret**, and **relation** that follow.

Below the relation are four **adjectives**.

Finally there are the dice results, d2 (a go stone, black or white), d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and a d3 (+, -, or =, Ã  la Fate). There is also the card **number** (makes it a d240).

I am sure I can find other ways to combine those various elements to come up with answers and suggestions that will be useful in my games.

I'm very happy with this deck of _Muses et Oracles_ cards, but I am still a little jealous of Xaosseed and his [Izirions West Marches Location Deck](http://seedofworlds.blogspot.com/2021/05/review-izirions-west-marches-location.html).
