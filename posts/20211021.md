Another find in the attic, the cards say 1994. I vaguely remember that I bought them in the period after [Interview with a Vampire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110148/).

At the back of the Starter Deck box is written in red:

> From the creators of _Magic: The Gathering&trade;_ comes an entirely new *Deckmaster* collectable trading card game based on White Wolf's popular storytelling game _Vampire: The Masquerade&trade;_. Intended for mature players, _Jyhad&trade;_ pits rival vampires against each other in a struggle for control over the sinister World of Darkness&trade;. You are an ancient Methuselah using political manipulation and force to dominate other vampires and drain your opponents' blood pool. The game is designed for two or more players: each player needs a deck to play. The complete set contains over four hundred cards and features full-color illustrations by the genre's most prominent artists. Join the _Jyhad_ where blood is your weakness â€” and your ultimate weapon!

Since at that time I wasn't surrounded by gamers, I bought four or five starter decks and some extension "bags" and tried to initiate friends to the game. It never really caught on, and _Magic_ was stronger anyway. I played _Magic_ only once or twice, I felt it was too technical and that you could rename the cards and change the illustrations and still play the same. It was not inspiring. But _Jyhad_ was. Maybe it's because it described a totally different parallel world, maybe because it was based on the storytelling _Masquerade_.

We're so skilled at populating the worlds of darkness.
