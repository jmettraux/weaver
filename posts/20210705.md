My intention was to write about [Coureurs d'Orages](http://legrumph.org/Terrier/?Chibi/Coureurs-d%27Orages), the game by [Islayre d'Argolh](http://jibidi.fumblefamily.org/), but since it claims its filiation to _Searchers of the Unknown_, I'll look at the ancestor first.

The concept of _Searchers of the Unknown_ thrones at the top of its single page rules:

> A typical old-school D&D module stats list for a monster looks like this: (AC6, MV9’, HD 1, hp 4, #AT1, D1-10 by halberd). The idea is that, if it’s enough for monsters, it should be enough for PCs too. This light-rule system enables to play these modules in that way.

I opened a copy of [B1: In Search of the Unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_the_Unknown) and yes, that's the way monster stats appear in there.

So, _Searchers of the Unknown_ is reverse engineered so that it can faifthfully _play_ those old modules where the only hard data are very compact monster stats. Now, combine the concept with the game subtitle "another minimal way to play D&D" and it's no surprise that the rules fit a single page.

What I like about the rules:

* It's a fighter and rogue game, spellcasters may appear, but as antagonists
* For initiative, one rolls 1d10 + AC, the lighter the armor, the swifter
* Morale rolls are 1d10, if superior to monster HD, it has failed

Example character sheet:

> Humphrey the bald (AC 5 MV 6 HD 3 hp 14 #AT 1 D 1d10 halberd)

_Searchers of the Unknown_ can be found for free on [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/shop/nicolas-dessaux/searchers-of-the-unknown/ebook/product-21361368.html) as a PDF.

There are many games based on it, there is a [compilation](https://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1368480942868.pdf) of them available on PDF, it contains the original SotU and 28 of its children, it was compiled around 2012. Nicolas "Snorri" Dessaix also maintains [Searchers of the Unknown](https://searchersoftheunknown.wordpress.com/) where they are listed, the newer entries are from 2020.

Not all of the "children" are one page long and not all of them respect the initial concept, but it's a pleasure to see these explosions of creativity.

The illustration at the top of the post is taken from [Hunters of the Unknown](http://legrumph.org/Terrier/?Jeux-de-role/Hunters-of-the-Unknown), a SotU-like game by John Grümph, it comes in two versions, a 26 page one in French and a 1 pager, in English.

Beautiful _exercices de style_.
