The player: "I am a sprite and the guard is a sprite as well, I try to seduce him!"

The gamemaster: "The guard notices you, there is a hint of a smile on his face. Roll your dice"

P1 rolls his two d12, a clear bright one and a dark one: "5 on the dream dice and 10 on the nightmare dice!"

GM: "So, your Seduction is at 6, 6 + 5 is 11, not 12. Your dream side cannot succeed, but your dark side give you 6 + 10, which is more than 12."

P1: "I go at the guard, closely, my eyes into his eyes, ..."

GM: "You go for the devious way, since your score of Dream is above your score of Nightmare, you have to incur 1 point of Nightmare debt"

P1: "I'll have to repay it later?"

GM: "Yes, at the end of the adventure, you'll have to repay your Dream or Nightmare debts, using points of experience, if you have XPs left, you can then improve your skills, adapt your Dream or Nightmare scores, or learn new spells"

P1: "I am not a spellcaster, could I have used a point of Dream to roll a second dream dice (rolling three dice in total) to make me magically more seducing?"

GM: "Yes, you could have, but look you've used your two Dream points in the previous fight to magically enhance your attacks..."

**Les Oubliés** is a french role-playing game involving tribes of faeries locked in our world around 1572. Most of the faeries have forgotten their original world, it doesn't matter to them, they have to survive here and now, among giants, rats, cats, and owls.

The twelve tribes of faeries all ended up in a gigantic Terra Incognita which is a fictional South of France city named St-Jean-de-Castel. Unknown to most of the faeries, outside of the city wall, the war of religions are ablaze. That makes for interesting layering of situations.

The faeries hate the giants (the humans), they are smelly, their voices are loud and obnoxious, but they dream, or sometimes, their dreams turn to nightmares.

Some of the faeries have specialized in extracting dream threads out of sleeping giants, it's a difficult job, being close to a giant when it dreams is equivalent to what we would call a bad trip, you have to hang tight, not succumb, extract the thread, and get away alive. Spellcasters need them for casting their spells, each thread is worth a lot.

Writing of nightmares, it seems that faeries from some kind of nightmare side have appeared, and some of our fearies of the dream are not deaf to the call of the nightmare.

**Player characters** are "Oubliés" (forgotten ones). Actually, growing up it started having visions. Those Oubliés gather in adventurers' companies lead by a captain and try to abide the by oath their forefathers had taken (and woke up inside of them).

The character creation doesn't involve any dice. One chooses its race, its tribe, its profession, distribute 12 points to up some skills, and a name.

The races are Fey (less than 4 cm), Gnome (4 to 5 cm), Belgfolk (5 to 6), Korrigan (5 to 6), Sprite (6 to 8), Goblin (7 to 8), Kobold (7 to 8), and Hairy Nutons (10 to 13 cm).

Choosing a race grants the character a base profile for its skill. Choosing a Belgfolk (Bergvolk, dwarf), gives you "hunter 1", "maker 5", "force of nature 5", "shadow 1", "savant 3". This means that your Belgfolk will start with 5 in each of the three skills under "maker", they are handicraft, intellect, and healing.

Each race description provides hints at how to get into the shoes of a character of the given race, and tells which tribe the race is mostly found in.

The next step is the selection of a tribe. There are eleven of them (the twelveth one got lost). They are Krograines, Karius, Ventrus, Sixts, Frinios, Pataches, Banshees, Vivitins, Margouts, Siccomores, and Huvons. (Choosing Siccomores restrains the next choice, professions, to Dream Mage).

Each tribe has a "majority race", so playing a minority race might be difficult (but rewarding for skills scores). Since the players are all Oubliés, they are already outcasts, but the tribe appartenance may play a very important part when the adventurer company has to deal with regular fearies not straying out of their tribes.

Choosing a tribe gives extra skill points. For example, choosing the Krograine tribe gives 2 to leadership, 2 to erudition, 1 extra language (old sprite), 1 to melee, 1 to ride, and 2 to will. Tribes each have myths and philosophies, and a territory (the Krograine live in the giants' benedictine cloister, the Siccomores are established in the jewish ghetto, ...).

Tribe and race description each come with key words, giving them semantic frames.

Before becoming an Oubliés, the character had learnt a trade. Now, as a member of an adventurer company, he has sometimes the opportunity to put that trade at use. There are eight trades, Dream Mage, Rêvirine, Knight Errant, Mercenary, Explorer-Merchantman, Cartographer, Sweet Dreamer, and Find-it-all.

Sweet dreamers are bards, while find-it-alls are thiefs (the victims are their thievery are giants most of the time).

Each trade provides extra skill points, for example, a mercenary adds 3 to mêlée, 3 to speed, 3 to athletism, and 1 to healing. The trade then tells what is the initial equipment of the character.

Then the player receives 12 extra points to add to his character skills. The contraints for the resulting skill scores are, no more than 6 for a skill listed in the four skills controlled by its choice of trade, and no more than 4 for other skills.

The next step is to assign Dream and Nightmare scores and points to the character. Since it's a child of the dream, the character gets a score of 1 in Dream and 0 in Nightmare. That gives 2 points of Dream and 0 points of Nightmare, and a start debt of 0 in Dream and 0 in Nightmare.

The final step is to give hit points to the character. It's simply the size of given by the race times 4, hence Belgfolk 8, Farfadet 12, Gnome 8, Kobold 12, Korrigan 8, Lutin 12, Hairy Nuton 16. The rulebook states that if you want to make it more gritty, feel free to multiply by 3 instead of 4.

Done, character created, no dice involved.

As written above, the characters are part of a **compagnie d'oubliés** lead by a captain. The character creation job is immediately followed by a session zero-esque definition of the ties between the members of the company.

The rulebook suggests creating the company then the characters is viable option as well. It doesn't tell who is the leader of the company. Maybe it's the character with the highest "leadership" score. In case of tie, who knows what might happen.

The group has to choose/devise with the gamemaster a "company power". For example, when the all the members of the company are in close range, they all gain +1 on damage, or the company has a reserve of 1 point of Dream that can be used by any member and regenerates at dawn, etc...
