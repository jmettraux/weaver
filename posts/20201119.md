## Wizards of the Costco

"High Fantasy" or "Costco Fantasy"? Books after books of plenty? Cornucopia of feats, monsters, subclasses and optimizations?

The [Systems Reference Document (SRD)](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) is a wonderful document, it may turn anyone with a connection and a PDF reader into a dungeon master.

I'd remove Dragonborn, Tiefling, Gnomes, I'd even go human only, reserving other "lineage" for encounters. I'd remove all the classes except the fighter, the rogue and some kind of sorcerer. Want to play a bard? Make a witty rogue with a luth. Want to play a druid? The dungeon master will perhaps let you play some kind of grove living shaman on top of the sorcerer.
