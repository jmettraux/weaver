[La Grand Aventure du Jeu de Rôle](https://amzn.to/3kQtIVt) is a book by Julien Pirou about, well, the great adventure of the role playing game.

The spine of the telling is the North American history of role playing games spilling from Avalon Hill [Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactics_(game)) to [Critical Role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Role). Weaved around it are the history of the role playing games in France and interviews of authors and actors of the field.

The "1975-1980 Les Pionniers" chapter is quite interesting, among the presented pionners are the [Empire of the Petal Throne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Petal_Throne), [Tunnels and Trolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_%26_Trolls), [Traveller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_(role-playing_game)), and [Bunnies & Burrows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunnies_%26_Burrows) and its "Bun Fu" combats.

The interviews feature [Sandy Petersen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Petersen), [Mike Pondsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pondsmith), [Croc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croc_(game_designer)), and [John Grumph](http://legrumph.org/Terrier/) among others. (I love [John's Tumblr](https://legrumph.tumblr.com/) btw).

Croc is the author of [In Nomine Satanis | Magna Veritas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Nomine_Satanis/Magna_Veritas) which was translated in English under the name [In Nomine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Nomine_(role-playing_game)). It is said that this translation is tame compared to its source. Croc informs us in his interview that someone in the Vatican Swiss Guard was buying all the supplements of "In Nomine Satanis" as they went to market via mail order. (It must be something to play a RPG in places and organizations heavily tied in History). Quick one, Wikipedia tells us that the Polish version was quickly removed from the shops, the Spanish version suffered no such fate.

There is much more in the book, I recommend [La Grand Aventure du Jeu de Rôle](https://amzn.to/3kQtIVt) for the Francophones out there.
