[Book Notes: The War of the Fists](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2021/05/book-notes-war-of-fists.html)

> [The bridge] of San Marziale, in particular, was considered "privileged beyond all the others to host those especially celebrated and notable wars [that are] put on for [visiting] Princes, Cardinals, and Great Lords of Italy, due to its location, beauty, convenience, and size" (it measured a good seventeen by fifty feet, according to de Ville).

A good saint for a semi-martial event.

[A simple system for supplies and hunting](http://spriggans-den.com/2021/05/21/a-simple-system-for-supplies-and-hunting/)

> So here’s my take on it. The foraging system is taken straight from the Expert set, and expanded with the hunting mechanic. With how often players will likely go hunting throughout a full campaign, I really don’t want to bother with having combat encounters with rabbits and deer that might just run away.

Poaching on the rise.

[Review: Brindlewood Bay](https://burnafterrunningrpg.com/2021/05/20/review-brindlewood-bay/)

> This is not a common genre in RPGs, but it’s very recognizable from popular culture; my players had no trouble feeling the setting and tropes of the game, especially after the cozy places group activity at the start. Characters are both broadly competent and physically vulnerable – while Brindlewood Bay is a generally safe environment, shadowy figures stalk around and the suspect is still at large.

Jason, the author of [Brindlewood Bay](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/307416/Brindlewood-Bay?affiliate_id=2746229) is also the host with [Tom](http://porcupinegames.com/) of the [Fear of a Black Dragon](https://foabd.libsyn.com/website) podcast.

[A Simple Way to Handle Ability Scores](https://9and30kingdoms.blogspot.com/2021/05/a-simple-way-to-handle-ability-scores.html)

> Roll is 5+ on 1d6. This is not a roll to succeed, but a roll to see if the task is finished in the shortest time possible (1 round, if performing an action in combat.) On a “failure”, the result is how much longer the task takes.

As always, I am adding this to my notes about "keeping the game fluid and fun".

[Micro Exposition for Game Masters](https://grumpywizard.home.blog/2021/05/20/micro-exposition-for-game-masters/)

> If your campaign world is not this world, at this time, and in this place, there are going to be elements of your setting that need description and explanation. The players won’t know the milieu’s history, its major figures, its architecture, technology or much of anything. You will have to provide them with that information.

Okay about encounters conveying information about the setting, but I do not get the logic in the last part of "If you want your players to learn something about the campaign setting and retain it, attach that information to an encounter. This is one reason I use random encounters."

[Wow. I FINALLY Get It!](https://bxblackrazor.blogspot.com/2021/05/wow-i-finally-get-it.html)

> Gygax has penned a magnificent mechanic in OD&D that has been completely lost in his inability to express it coherently.

Writing rules is hard.

[Gygax 75](https://diyanddragons.blogspot.com/2020/08/gygax-75.html)

> There's a worldbuilding challenge called Gygax 75 that's been making the rounds on the blogosphere. I decided to try to look its origins and follow the people who undertook it, as is my way.

Lots of worldbuilding efforts are detailed there. A dungeon and a home base in a wilderness region in a larger world.

The top of the list sent me to [World Building with Gary Gygax in his Later Years](https://dragonsneverforget.wordpress.com/2021/04/21/world-building-with-gary-gygax-in-his-later-years/)

> Lists of lists. The lists of lists. And I said Gary, where’s the romance? Where’s the drama? - Oh players don’t want drama, Chris. They’ll make that up on their own.

[Stay in the Fiction](https://slyflourish.com/stay_in_the_fiction.html)

> I come back to the same general advice: stay in the fiction. Instead, of asking how the game mechanics work for something, ask how that thing works in the world and then let the mechanics represent that.

and also

> first look for monsters that make sense for the environment.

[Entretien avec Xavier “Tikokh” Brault autour de Okimba : Le Jeu de Rôle](https://culturejdr.fr/2021/05/16/entretien-avec-xavier-tikokh-brault-autour-de-okimba/)

> On peut vraiment résumer ce jeu de rôle en 3 mots. La survie, la tribu et le mystère.
Survie, parce que c’est un monde sans pitié et épique qu’il faudra affronter avec nos crocs et nos griffes.
Tribu, parce qu’ensemble, il est plus facile de survivre et la tribu devient tout pour l’individu même si tout semble vouloir séparer les gens entre eux, différentes races, différentes religions, différents modes de vie, etc… Il faudra donc apprendre à vivre ensemble.
Enfin, les secrets, le manque d’information dû à une tradition orale et surtout le monde des esprits apportent cette brume qui noie le tout dans le mystère !

Do excuse my French, there is a very interesting roleplaying game named [Okimba](https://fr.ulule.com/okimba-le-jeu-de-role/) getting crowdfunded.

The author is [interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=630Lx7_IAwo) (French again) on the _Vieux Geeks_ channel as well. Tikokh comes from the [Réunion Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9union) in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar, no dwarves nor elves in sight.

[Meet the new boss: some thoughts on domain-level play](https://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2021/05/meet-new-boss-some-thoughts-on-domain.html)

> They've built bridges. They've set up trade routes. They've negotiated diplomatic marriages. They've organised the planting of stands of date palms and the digging of irrigation canals. I keep worrying that they'll get bored by all this SimCity stuff, but they insist they're really enjoying it. Mysterious wildernesses on the edge of the map remain resolutely unexplored in favour of yet more civil engineering.

"Stay in the fiction!" as written above.

[My Father’s Dragon is OSR](https://newschoolrevolution.com/2021/05/17/my-fathers-dragon-is-osr)

> The book is about a boy who travels to an island to free an enslaved baby dragon. The dragon is being used to ferry animals across a river (see map), being held captive by cruel and intelligent animals

Looks like a wonderful book.
