I am not done with [Playing at the World](20211214.html?t=Playing_at_the_World&f=fairy_stories), far from it, in fact I am still in its initial chapters, specifically the one that details the why to the setting to Chainmail and then Dungeons & Dragons.

Concurrently, I am reading Tolkien's [On Fairy-stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Fairy-Stories). That maps nicely with the bigger book above (that references the smaller and earlier book).

(I usually have one book downstairs and one book upstairs, they don't follow me, I pick up the one closest at hand)

Here is an extract from this 1939 Tolkien lecture:

> (50) Children are capable, of course, of _literary belief_, when the story-maker's art is good enough to produce it. That state of mind has been called 'willing suspension of disbelief'. But this does not seem to me a good description of what happens.
>
> What really happens is that the story-maker proves a successful 'subcreator'. He makes a Secondary World which your mind can enter. Inside it, what he relates is 'true': it accords with the laws of that world. You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were, inside. The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather art, has failed. You are then out in the Primary World again, looking at the little abortive Secondary World from outside.
>
> If you are obliged, by kindliness or circumstance, to stay, then disbelief must be suspended (or stifled), otherwise listening and looking would become intolerable. But this suspension of disbelief is a substitute for the genuine thing, a subterfuge we use when condescending to games or make-believe, or when trying (more or less willingly) to find what virtue we can in the work of art that has for us failed.
