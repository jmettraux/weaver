## Eow Links 44

"Eow" for [End Of Week](/#eow). TTRPG Links I gathered during the week. This is iteration 44.

For more weekly links, head to The Seed of Worlds [Shiny TTRPG link collection](https://seedofworlds.blogspot.com/search/label/weekly%20links). There are also Ruprecht's [Best of the Web](https://ruprechtsrpg.blogspot.com/search/label/Best%20of%20the%20Web), and [The Indie RPG Newsletter](https://ttrpg.substack.com/) with its weekly links.

Most of the links below are found via the [RPG Planet](https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/) that Alex Schroeder built and maintains. If you have a RPG blog, please consider [joining the conversation](https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Planet/Please_join!).

Still on the road, between antigen tests and family dinners, I had to skip a whole two days of blog posts, hence the shorter list below. My favourite is ["Arnesonian" play](https://lichvanwinkle.blogspot.com/2021/10/arnesonian-play.html).

[Campaign spin up III: session zero in action](https://seedofworlds.blogspot.com/2021/10/campaign-spin-up-iii-session-zero-in.html)

> First was the hook to pull things together. Bitter experience has shown that there needs to be a good match between the strength of the bonds holding the group together and the type of campaign being run or it turns into a mess.

<hr/>

[What is Enough?](https://grumpywizard.home.blog/2021/10/28/what-is-enough/)

> I’ve accepted that my purchase decisions are more about emotion and aesthetic than anything that makes logical sense.

<hr/>

[On Ability Scores (Them Deeper Bones design diary 10)](https://strangeworlder.medium.com/on-ability-scores-them-deeper-bones-design-diary-10-5b6828db46f6)

> This left me with Constitution. And it would have been weird to have one of the Ability Scores be just like the “old ones”, so I renamed it to Stamina, even if it effectively the same.

<hr/>

["Arnesonian" play](https://lichvanwinkle.blogspot.com/2021/10/arnesonian-play.html)

> The common idea of "Arnesonian play" must therefore be a kind of myth.

<hr/>

[Featured Artist: Rosaleen Norton](http://theotherside.timsbrannan.com/2021/10/featured-artist-rosaleen-norton.html)

> She referred to herself as a "witch" and used altered states of consciousness to make her art. She often called herself "Thorn", much like a craft name. But her friends all called her Roie.

<hr/>

[Review - How to Make War By James F. Dunnigan](https://www.theseoldgames.com/2021/10/review-how-to-make-war-by-james-f.html)

> Nothing plays out worse than declaring a goal that cannot be obtained. Don't make threats, make promises.

<hr/>

[On Emphyrio and Vance's Libertarianism](https://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2021/10/on-emphyrio-and-vances-libertarianism.html)

> Those who have read their Tocqueville will recognise in Ambroy something akin to the dismal portrait he depicts of the fate of democracy.

<hr/>

[Early Evolution of Encounter Text](https://deltasdnd.blogspot.com/2021/10/early-evolution-of-encounter-text.html)

> But whoever was compositing the exact text in each case, at this point Gygax was comfortable, or felt it was a requirement, to produce adventures with very elaborate and extensive descriptive text for many or most encounter areas.
