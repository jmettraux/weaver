## Mapping Lindisfarne

I am building this [archelaus](https://github.com/jmettraux/archelaus) tool to generate hex maps I use as gamemaster in my session preparation. I've just generate a [map of Lindisfarne](docs/20210119_lindisfarne.html) and its surroundings.

This is a continuation of [Eminences in Green](20201220.html?s=lindi&t=Eminences_in_Green) and [Mobile Eminences](20201228.html?s=lindi&t=Mobile_Eminences).

The tool generates an SVG map in an HTML file. It prints OK.

I am slowly making improvements. This new version has a ruler embedded. It only plays nice on a desktop or laptop computer, not on iPad. But I could use it to "alk" from the southeast corner of the island to its northwest one, it's 5.4km, so maybe 1 hour for determined walkers.

Granted, with the big 1km hexes, it's even faster to count up to 5 and half. But at some point, I'd like the ruler to indicate the elevation delta, maybe compute the effort required.

I still have a lot of work to do, but the maps are already useful.
