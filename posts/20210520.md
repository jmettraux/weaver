_First Legends_, its character creation, skill and combat system.

_First Legends_ is a 1985 french role-playing system, that originates in the 1983 _Legends_ system. It is instantiated three times in _Celtic Legends_, [Legends of the Round Table](20210518.html?f=premieres_legendes&t=La_Table_Ronde), and _Legends of the Valley of the Kings_.

I read recently the rules for _Legends_ and did not understand much. I was reading it from the point of view of a _First Legends_ users and almost couldn't find any known landmarks, more than 30 years of distance in time did not help either. Reading the reviews about _First Legends_, one is told that _Legends_ character creation was a 3 hours long affair and that the system had a reputation of lacking fluidity. _First Legends_ came in as a welcomed rework of _Legends_.


## Gifts and Characteristics

Primo, a character in _First Legends_ has eight gifts, **Combat**, **Magic**, **Art**, **Communication**, **Perception**, **Mechanics**, **Nature**, and **Faith**. The player rolls 1d4 for each of them, hoping for fours. Then, the player rolls 2d4 and distributes those extra points on the gifts, respecting the maximum of 8 point for a single gift.

Secundo, a character has two core characteristics: **Physical** and **Mental** (French has _Physique_ and _Psychique_, I translate to _Mental_ for this post). The base score in each of them is 1. The player then rolls 4d4 and distributes the resulting points between Physical and Mental, the maximum score for one of them is 12. A score of 5 to 6 is average, 10, 11 and 12 are exceptional.

_Physical_ has three sub-characteristics, **Strength**, **Speed**, and **Coordination**. _Mental_ has three sub-characteristics, **Will**, **Decision**, and **Intelligence**. The base rule says that a sub-characteristic is equal to its parent characteristic, but there is an optional rule (that we liked very much) that says that points can be shuffled around sub-characteristics within characteristic plus or minus 2 (min 1, max 14). One may thus do:

<pre style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 0.9rem; margin: 1.4em 0; padding: 1.4em 1.2em;">
Physical       10     Mental       11    Appearance   8      Strain points = 2 * 10 + 11 = 31
      Strength  12            Will  13          Aura   9
         Speed   9        Decision   9        Beauty   9
  Coordination   9    Intelligence  11       Honesty   6
</pre>

I included the third characteristic **Appearance** and its sub-characteristics **Aura**, **Beauty**, and **Honesty**. The score for _Appearance_ is 3d4-2. Point shuffling by optional rule is possible as well.

**Strain** points are computed `Physical * 2 + Mental`. They correspond to the classical _Hit Points_. There are no levels in this game system and, as you age, you _Physical_ and _Mental_ score might decrease, cascading downstream to skills, strain points, etc.


## Skills

Here is the skill tree of the _First Legends_ system. In uppercase our the gifts, in capital case (first letter upper) are the characteristics. The skill names are all lowercase:

<pre style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 0.9rem; margin: 1.4em 0; padding: 1.4em 1.2em;">
                    COMBAT        Physical         Mental           Appearance

</pre>

See how all skills fall under a gift and a characteristic? For example, in the third column _acrobatics_ falls under _Perception_ and _Coordination_. Now, gifts (uppercase) range from 1 to 8 and characteristics from 0 to 12 (even 14). 8 + 12 = 20, it's a d20 roll under system.

A character doesn't get all the skills at full Gift + Characteristic score like this. Without formal training the skill score is equal to its gift score (except for skills with a star, like the alphabets or the poisons which start at 0).

Each skill to get its full Gift + Characteristic score has to be learned. This can be done by consuming one learning point and the time specified for the skill (2 years for mathematics, 6 months for axes, etc).

A character receives 12 **learning points** plus their social status points (see my [previous post](20210518.html?f=premieres_legendes&t=La_Table_Ronde), nobles whatever their rank receive 7 status points).

_First Legends_ games have classes, each of those classes has 10 mandatory skills. For example, a juggler has to learn dancing, theater, humor, trading, seduction, acrobatics, agility, imitate, handle, and animal knowledge. Their starting age becomes 4d4 + 9 years. The juggler still has (12 + status) - 10 learning points to use. 1 learning point can be used to learn a new skill or to add 1 point to the score of an already learned skill. The player should not forget to add the time spent to his character starting age for those extra skills or extra skill points.

It is totally okay to build a character outside of a class frame, the player just uses the 12 + status learning points and sums up the years required to learn each skill.


## Skills

Each skill gets a description in the rules. There are skill usage suggestions. For example, here is _eloquence_:

<pre style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 0.9rem; margin: 1.4em 0; padding: 1.4em 1.2em;">
# Eloquence (Aura) 1 year

Contrarily to the Convince skill, eloquence favors form over content. It's the art of convincing an audience with beautiful sentences. In case of debate, the success margin of the speakers are compared.

## Advise (+3)

The higher the success margin, the easier the pieces of advice and suggestions will be accepted.

## Enthuse (0)

Rally the audience to your advice.

## Fanaticize (-3)

If successful, the character fanaticize their audience before a fight or any other task requiring iron will and a fair amount of energy. In case of success, the audience benefits from a +1 modifier on any tentative for the task, for a duration of success margin x 1 minute.

Strain: 1 point
</pre>

_First Legends_ actively uses success margins and failure margin. For instance if a character tries to convince an audience, with Eloquence 15 and rolls a 9, the margin of success is 6. If one looks at the [Charte Angoumoise](20201130.html?t=charte_angoumoise&f=premieres_legendes), a 6 corresponds (second column) to "Very Good".

A second thing to notice is that using some of the skills may lead to straining.


## Combat Skills

Here are the description of three combat skills, _sword_, _big shield_ and _dodging_:

<pre style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 0.9rem; margin: 1.4em 0; padding: 1.4em 1.2em;">
# Sword (physical) 6 months

Do not forget that the sword is reserved to Knights and Nobles.

## Short sword

Attack (+2), Parry (-3), min strength 1 hand 3, min coordination 2

## Broadsword

Attack (+3), Parry (-2), min strength 1h 7, min coordination 2

## Longsword

Attack (+3), Parry (-2), min strength 1h 6, min coordination 2

## Bastard sword

Attack (+3), Parry (-3), min strength 1h 10 2h 8, min coordination 2

## Espadon

Attack (+4), Parry (-4), min strength 2h, min coordination 2
</pre>

<pre style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 0.9rem; margin: 1.4em 0; padding: 1.4em 1.2em;">
# Big Shield (strength) 6 months

## Big round shield

Parry (0), min strength 1h 6, min coordination 1

The regular footman shield.

## Big knight shield

Parry (0), min strength 1h 5, min coordination 1

Parry (+3) against missiles.

The shield used by knights when on foot.
</pre>

<pre style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 0.9rem; margin: 1.4em 0; padding: 1.4em 1.2em;">
# Dodging (physical) 6 months

This skill lets a character avoid an attack completely.

## Dodging (0)

The character dives out of reach (3 meters approximately), they need a full turn to dodge and stand up again (no other action possible).

## Feint (-5)

The character attempts at avoiding a single attack by a slight move. Another action (attack, parry, or a second feint) may still be attempted in this turn).
</pre>

Those three descriptions may help piece together the combat system of _First Legends_. In a turn (3 seconds) a character may perform two actions (attack, parry, dodge or other). Dodging when successful saves the character from any damage.

An attack when successful inflicts its success margin in damage points. The defender may attempt a parry, whose success margin is deducted from the damage points. If the defender is wearing an armor, 2 (leather), 3 (mail), damage points are absorbed. The remaining damage points are subtracted from the strain points.

For example, if Alfred with Sword 15, attacks with his longsword (+3) and rolls 10, is margin is 8. Brand parries with his longsword 14 (-2), he rolls a 9, the damage are reduced by 3. Since Brand is wearing a leather armor, he takes 8 - 3 - 2 = 3 damage points.

</figure>

Actions are meant to be resolved simultaneously. The _rapidity_ sub-characteristic of the characters may be used to order their declaration of intent (or to introduce an initiative system).

There is an optional rule for critical success and critical failure. For damage for example, rolling a 1 might lead to automatic success, leading to 20 + the margin of success of the second roll (or 0 if that 2nd roll fails) in damage points (before parry and absorption).

Should a character be reduced to 0 strain points, they fall into a coma. Should a character be reduced to minus his max strain points, they immediately die.


## Conclusion

I haven't described the magic system and the skill improvement system, but they are not that complicated and are in line with the general skill system.

Creating a character was quite fast, and, when sufficiently skilled in subtraction, the _First Legends_ system is fluid enough. The strain points weren't that numerous so fights weren't that long.

The _tournament_ skill of the Round Table instance was fun and we played some exciting tournament fights with the Knight characters. We also used the localized damage rules a lot and hits to the head were celebrated noisily.

We had a lot of fun as teenagers playing _First Legends_. We were then lured into Dungeons and Dragons. I have to admit I now feel nostalgic for those clear rules and those success margins. Maybe I could try them again for a one shot.
