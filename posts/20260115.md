## Warring States

General Orders "Sengoku Jidai" is a fine game. It feels tighter than its father game, General Order "World War II", and the box is even twice more compact. You can put the game in your backpack and play it with a friend on the road. It's easy to teach and easy to remember.

There is just enough randomness (dice for combat, effect cards, and three random locations) and plenty of planning involved. I wonder if it'll tease and please chess-oriented friends.

Maybe, after a few games, the excitement will have vanished, but it doesn't take much room on the shelf and can be brought back to the table with minimal pain as it's well designed and matured.

I just wish the map hexes were a bit roomier.
