"Eow" for [End Of Week](/#eow). Links I gathered during the week. This is iteration 2.

* [Wolves of God](https://anchor.fm/conrad-kinch/episodes/Wolves-of-God-Review-ecemlf) a review of Kevin Crawford's Anglo-Saxon role-playing game by Conrad Kinch on his [Send Three &amp; Fourpence](https://anchor.fm/conrad-kinch) podcast.

I was pointed at [Wolves of God](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/308470/Wolves-of-God-Adventures-in-Dark-Ages-England?affiliate_id=2746229) by the kind people on [The Adventuring Party](http://theadventuringparty.net/) discord server.

I have acquired the game as a piece of documentation for my AD 890 Northumbrian campaign. I did a first diagonal pass through it in PDF, but wasn't hooked. I have however received it in paper form and I am pleasantly hooked this time. Digging...

* [Critical Role, Pokemon, and the Future of D&amp;D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf8LhRDMHyA) which points to [The Critters are the Future of D&amp;D](https://deathtrap-games.blogspot.com/2020/12/the-critters-are-future-of-d.html)

> It's moving towards a D&D singularity where every character is essentially the same: a furry, battle-ready spellcaster that can do almost everything, that has little or no flavor beyond the eight-page backstory that its players bring to the table.

Nicely said.

* [Alien RPG Actual Play 1/3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY3OhbOOtxo) and [2/3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iwZVkZhUjM&t=17s), and SORRY, it's in French. It made me rewatch [Alien (1979)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iwZVkZhUjM&t=17s) and I still love it, after all those years.

One of the players kept informing the others about why he was acting like a jerk instead of simply acting like a jerk, it was a bit puzzling, the guy seems to be an actual comedian. Got me also thinking about roleplaying groups with formal hierarchies versus roleplaying groups where charisma sets the hierarchy.
