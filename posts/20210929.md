This is not an [everyday carry](https://everydaycarry.com/) post. It looks a bit like it, but it's more a _travelday carry_ post. TDC?

I'll be on the road in the old country and I hope to play with family and old friends.

The rules used are homebrewed, so I could fit them in staple stitched booklets and I printed enough so that each player will have her or his copy.

For the next iteration, I'll make landscape oriented character sheets, they'll thus match the A5 booklets.

I'm taking _Frost Ogres_ and _Adventures_. Not sure I'll play the first one, as it's a campaign, but I'm planning to run "Du Rififi à Maupertuis" from _Adventures_, it seems it's a convenient one shot. The books are in A5 format as well, but not saddle stitched, I hope the binding will hold.

I still have a bit of light work adapting the monsters to my ruleset, but it's merely computing the saves and the attack bonuses.
