This is not an [everyday carry](https://everydaycarry.com/) post. It looks a bit like it, but it's more a _travelday carry_ post. TDC?

I'll be on the road in the old country and I hope to play with family and old friends.

* pouch with molle system on the back
* 3 × A3 battlemats with squares and squeezed [hexes](https://github.com/jmettraux/hexes_and_squares/blob/master/a4_portrait_hexnsquares.pdf)
* set of non-permanent markers
* set of pencil with small sharpener
* permanent marker (to flag the meeples)
* 2 × small notepads
* 4 × staple stitched homebrew rules
* 5 × blank character sheets
* Gallant &amp; Bold [Aventures](https://www.lulu.com/search?adult_audience_rating=00&page=1&pageSize=10&q=coeurs+vaillants+aventures) and [Frost Ogres](/20210727.html?t=Frost_Ogres&f=on_the_road)
* 10 × numbered red meeples for the opposition
* meeples in various colours for the adventuring party or terrain features
* 3 × 30ft sticks (human walking distance for one round)
* 2 × 40ft sticks (other)

The rules used are homebrewed, so I could fit them in staple stitched booklets and I printed enough so that each player will have her or his copy.

For the next iteration, I'll make landscape oriented character sheets, they'll thus match the A5 booklets.

I'm taking _Frost Ogres_ and _Adventures_. Not sure I'll play the first one, as it's a campaign, but I'm planning to run "Du Rififi à Maupertuis" from _Adventures_, it seems it's a convenient one shot. The books are in A5 format as well, but not saddle stitched, I hope the binding will hold.

I still have a bit of light work adapting the monsters to my ruleset, but it's merely computing the saves and the attack bonuses.

very cool

What are/where do you get those measuring sticks from? They look nice and
easy to use.

Hello, I designed and 3d printed them myself. I wrote [Thirty Fourty Sticks](20201128.html?f=comment-20210929-2&t=Thirty_Fourty_Sticks) about them last year.

If you have access to a 3d printer feel free to print them. Here are the files:

* [30ft stick](https://github.com/jmettraux/rpg.scad/blob/master/_stl/six_stick.stl) (human "walking" stick, 30ft 9m 6sq t)
* [40ft stick](https://github.com/jmettraux/rpg.scad/blob/master/_stl/eight_stick.stl) (40ft 12m 8sq F)
* [50ft stick](https://github.com/jmettraux/rpg.scad/blob/master/_stl/ten_stick.stl) (50ft 15m 10sq V)

Thanks and best regards.
