## Casus Belli 38

I've just received my paper copy of Casus Belli 38. I already wrote about it in [Narration Principal](20210927.html?f=cb38&t=Narration_Principal) when the PDF version was made available.

When I was a kid, Casus Belli was almost my only source of information. Now, with the Internet, the magazine feels slightly out of date at each time. But scenarii and critics/opinions do not feel out of sync.

Speaking of scenarii:

* _Monsterland_ for [Monstres](https://www.black-book-editions.fr/news-3003.html) de Joann Sfar (also the author of [The Rabbi's Cat](https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/book/the-rabbis-cat). This scenario was played as a [one-shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyt3LFVYmdo) in actual play (23 pages);
* _Le Septième Fragment_ for the Call of Cthulhu (15 pages);
* _Le Prophète de l'Echec_ for Laelith (city setting for DnD 5e) (11 pages);
* _Fuites_ for The Expanse (9 pages);
* _Diversion_ for Aquablue (13 pages).

There are plenty of reviews, small and large, here are the ones that I noticed:

* [Les Brumes](https://www.gameontabletop.com/cf354/les-brumes.html), an interactive dungeon system, usable in solo or as a RPG module (5e);
* [Macchiato Monsters](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264169?affiliate_id=2746229), I guess I don't need to tell what it is;
* [Sur les Chemins de l'Empire](http://www.legrog.org/jeux/empire-des-cerisiers/chemins-de-l-empire-fr), I wrote about it under [Roads of the Empire](http://localhost:7000/20210818.html?f=cb38&t=Roads_of_the_Empire).

There is a "cesspit exploration guide" that looks promising with its 20 random tables. It's meant for Laelith, the city-setting proposed by Casus Belli, but could be adapted to other settings.

There is a sandbox for _Hexagon Universe_ placed in Fontaineblau during the german occupation. Scary.

The "Archéo-Rôlisme" column is about _Shadowrun_ and the "Archéoludologie" one is about _The Adventures of Indiana Jones_. The latter didn't seem to have survived.

My favourite piece is the interview of [Sophie Viger](https://www.42.us.org/interview-with-sophie-viger-managing-director-of-42/), who leads the [Ecole 42](https://www.42.us.org/). She said: "I am surprised that the Casus Belli readers do not yet know that _rôlistes_ already control the world".
