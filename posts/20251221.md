## Change of Tack

I hope to recycle this blog. Why "recycle"? Because I'm a moving away from the table top role playing game focus, towards writing more about board games and miniature games.

My current group of gaming friends is very heterogeneous in taste and open to try various games and let them spread their wings in memorable sessions.

I am having fun building terrain for [Trench+Crusade](https://trenchcrusade.com) these days. I want to write about this endeavour. The picture adorning this post is of a fdm-printed yeoman I am using as a kind of land surveyor for the terrain pieces I am putting together.

Trench+Crusade has found me via [Blanche, The Rise of Grimdark](https://wombatwargames.com/blanche/). The availability and practicality of the rules, the miniature agnosticism, and the anchoring in History convinced me. Three friends are preparing warbands and I'm focusing on terrain building. Our objective is to play our first games in January.

One of these trench friends suggested we go directly with a campaign. I suspect the fertile ground of the T+C timeline gets his imagination going and he wants to tell a story, as should be.

There is a role playing oneshot project on the backburner, I'll write about it, hopefully next summer. For now, bear with me, boards and miniatures.
