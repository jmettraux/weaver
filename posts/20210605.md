## Eow Links 23

"Eow" for "End Of Week". Links I gathered during the week. This is iteration 23.

For more weekly links, head to The Seed of Worlds [Shiny TTRPG link collection](https://seedofworlds.blogspot.com/search/label/weekly%20links) or Alex's [Blogosphere posts](https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Blogosphere).

Most of the links below are found via the [RPG Planet](https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/) that Alex Schroeder built and maintains. If you have a RPG blog, please consider [joining the conversation](https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Planet/Please_join!).

I post every other day, so the EOW links fall on Saturday or Sunday. This is a Saturday EOW, it might be shorter than a Sunday EOW.
