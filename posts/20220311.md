The two images are taken from a very dark comic named [Carbone 6 & Silicium 14](https://www.ankama-shop.com/en/label-619/2754-mathieu-bablet-carbone-silicium.html). The image above shows six humans/beings escaping into other worlds.

On the right, the escape is done with the medium of a book. On the left, five people are connected into a shared box. It seems it's a small network, just for them.

The comics says that the five people congregate to chat and solve mathematical problems together. This is rendered as the image below.

I said the story was very dark, it ends with the earth ravaged. This episode depicting people escaping the decaying physical world haunts me, and translates to people playing virtual-top role playing games.

There is still hope that playing the role and the game makes better people and better people will make a better physical world.
