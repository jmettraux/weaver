The first game of the year was a trek on the [Vantage](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420033/vantage) planet. It's the fifth time I venture there, and each time has been different.

I like that each player has to describe where he is, instead of simply showing his location card to his companions, a mechanism of immersion. I like the two negotiations around the dice rolling: before the roll, when you offer skill tokens to control the dice count, and after the roll, to absorb the cost of the action.

All the actions succeed, until your gauges reach zero and the game ends, unless you decide to probe further.

Yesterday evening saw us wander without a mission or a destiny. I was a bit puzzled, did I miss a step in the instructions? Maybe the red wine, or the heavy snow outside. Curse of aimlessness.

The game waits in its heavy box, you drop it on the table, flip 3 stack of location cards at the vertical, head for page 000 and you are playing. Time to table is short. Replayability feel high, you won't remember it all, you'll forget it and it'll fragment, and then feel new.
