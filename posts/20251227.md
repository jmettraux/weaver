## Dugouts

I "subtracted" dugouts from some of my trench hexagons. I didn't give them a bottom and they're big enough for a 25mm based miniature to fit in.

I've seen them in many of the diagrams about World War One trenches. They seem to have been used to protect soldiers from the rain and from artillery blasts. I wonder how they played out during an enemy "coup de main", maybe they provided a covered fire position to prevent the adversary from progressing.

Let's hope suppressive fire and a carefully thrown hand grenade did not turn the dugout to a grave.

I'm looking forward to see how it plays out with the [Trench+Crusade](https://www.trenchcrusade.com/) rules.

The trench in the picture, as can be guessed by translucence, is straight. It's the only hexagon that got this configuration, a 12 inches long trench. As explained in the [previous post](20251224.html?t=Trench_Hexagons), I favoured trenches taking turns, where blasts dissipate. Since this trench is straight, I gave it two dugouts.

One dugout on the left hand, and another one on the right hand. The modular fire steps will be placed at setup depending on the direction of the enemy.

The dugouts have no bottoms of their own, the miniatures in them will stand on the table itself, covered except for their heads.

I don't know yet how my terrain will turn out. I hope it will be okay. It should not steal the light from the miniatures my friends will choose, paint, and field. I think that by sticking to the 1914 I know from pictures and books what I build should play nicely with the hellish madness of the Trench+Crusade factions.

And, after all, the Great War was hell. You were a farmer and you joined the workers in an industrialized, not yet mechanized, slaughter.

Demons are easier to draw.
