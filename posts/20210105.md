I combined the excellent [Umbiology rework](https://github.com/Umbyology/OGL-SRD5) of the [SRD document](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) to Markdown with the [Edward Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and came up with [laconi.co](https://laconi.co).

This is all I need for our [campaign table](index.html?tags=bnd). I just replace the Wizard with a [Weaver](20201202.html?f=lco&t=The_Weaver).

I am tempted to drop Elf and Dwarf. Our campaign is in a human world bordered by a fantasy world.

I am also tempted to drop any price list and coinage tables. That's campaign dependent.

There are no background tables. There are no roll tables.

I didn't include monsters with no root in any folklore.

It's not for the pleasure of removing. More for the pleasure of having some kind of platform.

Monsters have their B/X Morale added as best I could, since I use reaction and morale rules from there.

Tasha Cornucopia? No, thanks.
