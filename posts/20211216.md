## Open Minds

I noticed a pattern in some actual plays. I mostly look (listen) to francophone actual plays, maybe the pattern is not present in english or other language actual plays.

The player is engrossed in their roleplay and declares unilaterally:

> I do this or say that and you all realize this or that and feel this or that way.

I stop and ask to the now frozen screen: "Do the other characters get a saving throw against this attempt at forcing thoughts and emotions into them?"
