## Histrion Npc Generation

I have enhanced the [histrion](https://github.com/jmettraux/histrion) NPC generator I use for [Wolves of Gods](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/308470/Wolves-of-God-Adventures-in-Dark-Ages-England?affiliate_id=2746229).

Well, it's one of those tools that always begs for a small enhancement, and I get a kick of satisfaction each time I iterate towards something better fitting my hand and my purpose.

Since I first [wrote about it](/20210204.html?t=Wog_Npc_Generation&f=20210301), I have added levels 2 to 10, given [spells](http://localhost:7000/20210211.html?t=Thread_Weaving&f=20211031) to weavers, and they also get petty goods in their pockets.

Here is Torolv, son of Askel, a weaver born in a religious family. He's good at spellcasting (though few people know). He knows [four ways](https://github.com/jmettraux/aac_magic/blob/90f7fa18cbfd24894d9e562926801909baaac237/src/spells.md) to weave threads.

He's not very imposing, but easily navigates the web of people around him, he is a good-enough hunter and knows a thing or two. His religious family background gave him the key to the entry-level rituals.

He's lucky, he has a piece of cheese in his pocket. The loose spearhead may be fitted on his staff, should the need arise.

I have this cron job that every 5 minutes generates [100 new characters](https://laconi.co/npcs.txt&f=20210301), it is a bit strange. A hundred personal stories scaffolded every five minutes. Yet the stories, they are not all read, they only come alive when one of us reads one of them.

The next step would be to pick a random religion (christian sect or pagan cult), I'd love to generate personalities, maybe I'm good with just looking at the stats and imagining them. I fear the roll on the personality table might add a last, killing, constraint.
