My [first exposure](images/20210625_add1_saving_throws.jpg) to saving throws was in the AD&amp;D 1st edition, the Dungeon Master's guide. Coming from [First Legends](20210518.html?t=La_Table_Ronde&f=saving_throws), the concept wasn't very straightforward for me, but the category names were making me dream: Paralyzation, Poison, Death Magic, Petrification, Polymorph, Rod, Staff, Wand, Breath Weapon, Spell...

I don't really remember saving throws in the Red Box, AD&amp;D second edition and third edition. Fast forward to 5th edition, and the saving throws feel very elegant. I like how a saving throw feels "aligned" on skill checks and attack rolls.

Now my battle horse is Wolves of God and the saving throws are different.

* Physical (Resistance) Save
* Mental (Resistance) Save
* Evasion ( / Dodge) Save
* (Sheer) Luck Save (Not in _Wolves of God_ proper, but in SWN and WWN)

The target number for a save is 16 minus the best of two attribute modifiers and the character level.

**Physical Resistance Saves** are requested when the character has to resist poision, disease, or exhaustion. The best of the STR and CON modifiers is chosen.

**Mental Resistance Saves** are used when resisting illusions, magical effects, temptation, and willpower challenges. The best of the WIS and CHA modifiers is chosen.

**Evasion Saves** for when nimbleness and reaction speed are essential. Ducking for cover, avoiding falling... The best of the DEX and INT modifiers is chosen.

**Sheer Luck Saves** are equal to 16 minus the character level, no attribute involved. It doesn't appear in _Wolves of God_, I think it's to help the referee use [wyrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyrd) instead.

Here is a table to render those save target numbers as percentages. The current _Sine Nomine_ games use 2d6 for skill checks, but 1d20 for attack rolls and saving throws, so here are the target numbers for a d20 and the corresponding percentage:

For example, a character of level 3 with a DEX modifier of +2 has to roll 11 or better on a d20 to avoid falling in a suddenly spotted pit, that's 50%.

I quite like this system, but I am tempted to unmoor it and align it on the attack rolls. Instead of the static 16 (minus level, minus modifier), I'd like to determine a different Difficulty Class for each set of circumstances. That makes it very 5th edition like, but the players are already used to give me their attribute modifiers when I request skill checks from them, it might be easier for them to remove the save numbers and stick with modifiers.

I could further unmoor the thing and go with attribute saves (still using the three + one basic saves). That'd make for three + six + one saving throws. Why not? It's probably better to stick to the **Physical resistance Save**, **Mental resistance Save**, and **Evasion Save**, their names tell it all, less explaining to do to the player.

Still, moving the 16 target up and down 5% and thus point at a difficult class is tempting. I need to make a _Mental Save_ myself to resist doing that.
