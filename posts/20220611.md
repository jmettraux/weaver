The town at the center of the county where I come from is built in a fold of a river. The river is also a frontier, to the west, romance people, to the east, the tide of alemannic tribes.

A valley starts perpendiculary, a tributary stream flows there. Thick mists emerge from the valley, especially in autumn mornings. There is nothing to be surprised at, the mists come straight out of the nostrils of the dragon that lives at the end of the gorge.

When there is storm and the rain falls hard, pieces of the cliff fall. There is nothing to be surprised at, the dragon moves in its sleep.

The gate above separates the town from the small valley. Can it withstand the onslaught of an angry dragon?
