[Dungeon World](https://dungeon-world.com/) is a game powered by the Apocalypse. There is a direct gate to its engine room.

from [When you read and understand Dungeon World, roll +INT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8_Fz4m5hcoiTXpTbklDOF9iUHc/view)

I have [Dungeon World](https://amzn.to/3qqleaW) on my bookshelf, right next to [Burning Wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burning_Wheel), must read, at least as a source of inspiration. It was starting to gather dust.

The devious YouTube algorithm proposed me to watch a few [jdrfactory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3nksGRcsiBJfjmx9ImBC1A) videos. _Sorry, French again_. They have an ongoing history of the role playing games that is brilliant. I especially appreciated the [Empire of the Petal Throne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Petal_Throne) [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aChRVuzsUBY).

The younger members of the channel had an excellent [discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plKewfA41WQ) about the games powered by the Apocalypse (_Propulsés par l'Apocalypse_ in French).

Here are some points they highlighted:

* Epiphany, PbtA codifies fiction, mechanism, fiction.
  Learning to be a GM the hard way, encountering PbtA and levelling up
* Dungeon World sits on two chairs, but may be considered a great gateway, it
  gives too few narrative tools to the players, its
  character archetypes only tell you how you'll hack the opposition.
  In a true PbtA Game, archetypes have different goals
* The move system may cut the action, but once used to it, it flows
* PbtA Games are harder to hack, you grant a +1 here and there, and it crashes
* Loss of authority for the GM, the GM has to let go
* Less than 6, the GM takes the hand, 7 to 9, the players tell what happens and the GM adds a twist, 10 or more, the players have the hand
* Less preparation for the GM, epiphany, so much preparation work to let go of!
* [Monster of the Week](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/143518/Monster-of-the-Week?affiliate_id=2746229) might be a better entry point for DnD people than Dungeon World

They point to the [french translation](http://acritarche.com/index.php/produits/guide-description/) of [When you read and understand Dungeon World, roll +INT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8_Fz4m5hcoiTXpTbklDOF9iUHc/view). I was intrigued, I looked around and found the original, in English, downloaded it and humbly proceeded to read it.

It is very good.

My favourite part is the custom moves section. I am a programmer and things like:
<pre>
When you are grabbed by the blood vines, roll +DEX
&nbsp;
on a 10+ both apply. On a 7-9, choose one that applies:
...your gear is undamaged
...you are unharmed
</pre>
are music to my ears.

My second favourite part is the sample worldbuilding exercise. It highlights two of the main principles of Dungeon World:

* Draw maps, leave blanks
* Ask questions and use answers

Of course, the meat is in the first part of the PDF, I need to re-read it. But I am already certain that the first read made me a better GM.

The video discussion made me want to look at:

* [Apocalypse World](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/194344/Apocalypse-World-2nd-Ed?affiliate_id=2746229)
* [The Sprawl](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/171286/The-Sprawl----MIDNIGHT?affiliate_id=2746229)
* [Night Witches](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146173/Night-Witches?affiliate_id=2746229)
