I got two boxes of Prussians. The assembly of those big miniatures was quick, the mould lines were easy to remove. A breeze.

Look at the field chaplain, isn't he glorious? His wings join in supporting his crown.

> By their sides march the Feldkaplan, knightly chaplains clad in
> the finest warplate crafted by the Prussian Institute of Metallurgy,
> wrought as winged angels and wreathed in holy smoke. Their
> burning blades light the way for their fellow soldiers, and
> their booming prayers fill the hearts of all who hear them with
> righteous hate for the enemies of God

Field chaplains? [+10 morale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXFuqxHp0EQ) and _Holy Smoke_ for fifteen ducats.

> Made of a mixture of frankincense, agarwood, and secret
> chemicals from the Mendelist Order, this burned incense is
> inhaled by Prussian Feldkaplan before battle. It is highly
> addictive but grants great physical and mental resilience.

I don't like the Prussians.

The first reason is the confusion they bring. 1939 Stahlhelm bad, 1914 Pickelhaube good. It feels like an exception, a design error that cannot be taken back.

The second reason is the image of the huge tank in the cathedral. It appears in [the Prussian PDF](https://www.trenchcrusade.com/app/uploads/2025/11/Prussian-Stosstruppen-Warband.pdf). It jumps tanks like the Mark I, the Renault FT-17, the A7V Sturmpanzerwagen and goes directly to the Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus. A battlefield where the grunt digs the earth to shelter from the artillery rain. Planes came later on, tanks came later on, attempting to nullify trenches, not quite successful at it, at breaktrough, not even thinking of exploitation. Any rupture of the front? No, leave that to Brusilov, our front had no rupture, but our crankshafts did.

The big fat tank fantasy is for world war two moustaches. The world war one tanks have their own flavour and were strategically surprising. Don't ditch them.

Maybe, the easiest fix would be to avoid Stahlhelm for the Heretics and let the Prussians be. If the Heretics somehow derive from the Templars, let's use their iconography and keep away from the Wehrmacht shadow.

Anyway, I now need to find a way to get paint on those plastic miniatures. They're gorgeous.
