"I made those wattle thinggies…"<br>
"Do you think that it will stop a horde of heretics?" asked Karl<br>
"No, these aren't meant to pen in sheeps or pigs, they are reinforcements for trench walls"

When looking at [images of trenches](https://imagesdefense.gouv.fr/fr/catalogsearch/result/?q=tranch%C3%A9es&p=1), I noticed that wattle reinforcements were not rare. I would guess that they were more common at the beginning of the conflict, and got supplanted later on as supply and the war effort took on and timber and corrugated metal sheets became available.

"Please roll a Basket Weaving skill check... Success!" I got a +1 DICE since I had made a basket for my Mom in primary school...

The vertical pieces of wood were easily to select, double-ended toothpicks. I pinned them upright in discarded pieces of XPS foam and started weaving [strips of light cardboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tWPl_9fhM8). It looked alright, but I could get no satisfaction. At scale, they looked like planks roughly a hands' width, sturdier than the coppiced sticks they slalomed.

The horizontal thread should be thinner than the vertical posts. I was fortunate to come over a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls2DnsBPzNU) about a WW1 diorama, that was using broom bristles. I put on my coat and went to the dollar shop to get a broom and here I was, weaving bristles from one toothpick to the next.

Now that I have rewatched the diorama video, I realize that the result of my efforts is plain. I like how the youtuber alternates vertical posts of different diameters, my toothipick game needs to be upped with the help of chicken skewers.

Need to dig more trenches before the _Boche_ arrives…
