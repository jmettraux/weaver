Three things I like in Knock #3.

1) The article by Justin Hamilton named "Less Rules to Do More".

> Back in the 1970s, gamers spoke about playing Greyhawk, or Blackmoor, or Tekumel. Now they discuss what dice systems they use or what family of games they enjoy.

2) "The 11 Questions You Need to Answer about your Ruins" by John Grümph.

> You have to get permission from the gods to pass.

3) The illustrations and the layout.

<p class="fleuron">❦</p>

You cannot use it at the table, it doesn't lay flat, and the players would want to steal it for themselves.

It's a Muse book, something to feed the hungry gamemasters, it's a collector book — I guess I'm not the only one buying two copies each time. The first copy is supposed to be adorned with post-its and bookmarks and to help in the preparation of games.

But it's a bric-à-brac, you open it and it's gamemaster rapture. There are myriads of posts about hexcrawls and exploration, maybe the genious in Knock is that it's where your lonely musecrawling happens. That first copy has to be annotated — difficult given its plentiful and colourful layout — and bookmarked and milestoned.

I travelled in this third iteration and I have the impression that the rhythm breaks at around three quarters. It's only an impression. It's perhaps because the bric doesn't brac and hints at modules and a bestiary, but I can't find the threshold.
