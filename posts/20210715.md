I am looking at ways to integrate money in my current campaign a mix of [Wolves of God](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/308470/Wolves-of-God-Adventures-in-Dark-Ages-England?affiliate_id=2746229) and other TTRPGS between Britain, Norway and the north of the Carolingian empire.

Pepin the Short, father of Charlemagne, around AD 755, [reestablished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius) the roman Denarius by stating that 240 pennies (denarii) would equate 1 pound (libra) of silver. To keep the compatibility with the system in use up until that point, the shilling (solidus) was kept, with 20 shillings for 1 pound of silver.

For three centuries after the reform, the only coin minted in Europe was the silver penny, with shillings and pounds as unit of account.

It seems that until the plague, coins were getting rarer, so I am enforcing the exchange of gifts and services, but I am keeping value tables around, because it's easier and also it seems people were thinking in denarii and solidi even when the actual coins were being turned into church ornaments or hoarded in other ways.

I started building a small tool named [lombard](https://github.com/jmettraux/lombard) to help me align value lists in the TTRPG systems I am looking at. I try to find a way to turn the value of object into days of labour. I want to share value tables with the players so that we all know how many days of unskilled labor are necessary to buy a pair of boots, (10 days for commoner's boots in WOG, 8000 for noble boots in [First Legends](20210518.html?t=La_Table_Ronde&f=labor_solidus_denarius)).

&nbsp;

Wolves of God is excellent because it specifies a day of hired labor as 1 penny. I extrapolate the day for the labor of a master to 3 pence.

I run the tables in the game through my tool and here is the output:

All in all, since all the prices are expressed in pence and one day of hired labor is one penny, the exercise is almost a waste, but I can now use other items (livestock heads for example) to interpret values.

&nbsp;

The last two "r" columns are the values for their rows expressed in laborer daily wage, and master daily wage. Those wages are printed top and bottom of the list.

The "v0" column is the value as listed in the game, the "v1" column is the value reinterpreted with the least coin possible, and the "v" column is the value in pence.

&nbsp;

[Légendes de la Table Ronde](20210518.html?t=La_Table_Ronde&f=labor_solidus_denarius) is a bit more problematic. I have currently set the laborer daily nominal wage at 1.5 pence and the master at 3 pence. The laborer has thus to toil 2.6 days to earn enough to acquire 1kg of rye bread.

I found those wages as nominal wages for England pre-plague (circa 1290). Which would be close to _Légendes de la Table Ronde_ mythical 12th century. Yet, it doesn't seem right. I have to set higher wages or compound three meals offered on the job, maybe.

This game also lists the [Bezant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezant) (bizantius aureus), the [Marc d'argent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_(currency)), and the [Farthing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farthing) (quarter of a penny). The Bezant is interesting because it seems it's what the shilling (solidus) was based on in the 755 Caroligian Reform. It went its own way and _Légendes_ (circa 1170) lists it as equivalent to 7 shillings.
