## The Wake

Have you ever played [Britannia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/240/britannia)? The Welsh flee to their tall hills and leave the plain to the Romans. Then things somehow repeat, Roman grip suddenly relaxes and Anglo-Saxons come in. Then 1066.

Paul Kingsnorth, what a grand name, you trapped me in the mind of Buccmaster, or was it in a fen in Anglia? "Fugol, Fugol" You say I see "Fugol" — "Look up!" — "Ah, _Vogel_!" — "_Ja_, you bird brain"

I have spent a whole book in the savage pride of freely holding three oxgangs, followed by a dane kid and a cottar. Surrounded by _Esels_, the only other emotion I knew was ire.

Madness exposed in asymmetry by the wisdom of servant woman, by the determination of a man fallen from his horse. My old gods are thy _deofol_, is thy world simpler than mine? When did my Anglo-Saxon panoply went out of fashion, how could it ever wipe thy smirk away?

The stupor in [The Buried Giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buried_Giant) was kindlier to awaken from. _Dankvoll_ for the punch in the gut, thankful for the escape to the fen, the [_Waldgang_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_J%C3%BCnger).

Septentrion King, I'll read "Against the Machine" next.
