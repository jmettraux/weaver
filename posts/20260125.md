Ill and Jinxed, almost in that order. Karl let me follow him in his quest for vine seeds in the 7th Citadel world. Vine seeds? I guess growing the seeds will help us secure our buildings against earthquakes. Earthquakes? I am sure they are linked to those worm attacks that occurred in the past, before the necro-druids showed up and thwarted their attacks. Narco-druids? No, necro-druids.

I played Denhom and even before falling sick and getting jinxed, I had the matching face, grey skin, and hair scared white. Denhom lost his family to the worms and clings to a fragment of hope, a necklace he had offered to his daughter and that re-appeared, this time circling the neck of a traveller from the south.

7th Citadel certainly inspired [Vantage](20260103.html?t=Vantage&f=herbalist_shack) which we played a couple of times, a few heavy stack of cards await us, revealing blade by blade, sunlight beating fog, a world of greenery (beware) and lakes. Since we started the session late, we only managed to find an herbalist lady in her shack, a whiff of civilisation. I got myself a hound — a hournd — with a discerning nose but couldn't put it to good use yet (on a roll of 1 it'll abandon me).

There is this Baald guy, he smiles a lot and sports too many hair, that must be the extra "a". I can't remember where we found him, it was probably on Karl's action, and he appointed him to me, to alleviate my lack of inventory.

When our respective card stacks went empty, we did recover, we converted hit points for extra cards, for our quests to go on.

We "saved" the state of the game in its box and shall continue on Tuesday evening. I like the maps and the fog of war. I like the dual use cards, hand versus stack, and the stack as a battery, an energy gauge. I have the impression of being brought back in a 1990s game. I didn't see much yet. I don't like this Baald guy, if he could stop smiling.

Still jinxed and ill still, it must be the wine.
