I automated the treasure/hoard generation tables of [Wolves of God](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/308470/Wolves-of-God-Adventures-in-Dark-Ages-England?affiliate_id=2746229), I was tired of the multiple rolls when preparing my sessions.

It's available under [https://weaver.skepti.ch/others/wog_treasures.html](https://weaver.skepti.ch/others/wog_treasures.html).

There are 14 text files re-rolled every three minutes there. One file for each level of wealth, from the humble ceorl to the treasury of a lost roman city. The very first of the file lists three items from the _Petty Goods_ table.

Here is an example output:

8 - Plunder Kept in a Bandit Lair - 720s (12L)

u: rusts, c: corrodes, p: perishes, d: dies, r: rots
1L = 60s / 1s = 4d / 1L = 240d
</pre>

I added flags (rust, corrodes, perishes, dies, rots) to the output. I think it is relevant for hoards that were forgotten. They should help adjust the output to the setting and circumstances.

The 13 hoards are also rolled as CSV files and available right next to their plain text counterparts.

There is a _Jewelry_ subtotal, I thought it necessary since it concerns items that are easily pocketable. Speaking of totals, if the players have a level in the skill _Gift_ (_Trade_) I give them the totals, else I give them only the left part, item descriptions and counts. Good luck carrying back and trading some of those items.

Regarding magical items, I blank out value and power. Again, good luck finding out what it really is, there is no user manual and characters don't know what they don't know.

The Empire was long gone but people were still valueing items and services along the Liber/Solidus/Denarius lines. By the way, David Graeber's [Debt: The First 500 Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years) is a must read.

> Although hard currency was no longer used in everyday life, its use as a unit of account and credit continued in medieval Europe. Graeber insists that people in the Middle Ages in Europe continued to use the concept of money, even though they no longer had the physical symbols.

Speaking of value system, here are two hints, wergild and some prices:

> A ceorl’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weregild">wergild</a> is 200 shillings, or the price of 40 cows. It might take ten common families to afford such a man’s life.

* [Sceatta coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sceat) (they appear sometimes in generated hoards)
