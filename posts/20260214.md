## Blood Markers

[Trench+Crusade](https://www.trenchcrusade.com/) has you place blood markers on models that took hits. Once your adversary models tries to do something you can convert a blood marker to a disadvantage. The resolution mechanism in Trench+Crusade lets you roll 2d6, you succeed if you do 7 or better. So converting a blood marker on a model, to a `-1 DICE`, you roll 3d6 and keep the 2 lowest.

There are also blessing markers, mostly granted by field priests, that can be used to grant `+DICE` to a resolution check when consumed.

I developed a dial for FDM 3d printing. It's composed of two pieces that snap together. I hope it will prove useful for Trench+Crusade and for other tabletop games. It's [available on Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/1598856-1-to-6-dials).
