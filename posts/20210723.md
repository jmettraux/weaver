I am translating here a piece of the [introduction](http://lapinmarteau.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01-Olivier-Ca%C3%AFra-Les-affleurements-du-r%C3%A9el.pdf) by Olivier CaÃ¯ra to [Jouer avec l'Histoire](http://www.legrog.org/jeux/generique-historique/jouer-avec-l-histoire-fr). The anecdote here sends me on multiple reflection paths.

> Historical worlds are sources of intrigues but they are not "tailored for adventure". They are not only a backdrop for epic fiction, they are frame where daily concerns are constantly involved, be it the evening meal or the construction of a cathedral. With their unexpected, even misleading, details, those daily concerns will catch seasoned players off guard.
>
> A table of roleplay gamers discovered during a convention "Te Deum for a Massacre". Very early in the session, the player characters are passed by a high-status hitch which carries a woman, her face covered by a mask. The gamemaster laughs _in petto_ as the players throw themselves into the wildest speculations, while the mask, the [visard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visard), in the Sixteenth Century, is worn to preserve the whiteness of the skin during outings and travels.
>
> Dramatic instrument _par excellence_, the mask is offsetting here because its use is simply cosmetic. Accustomed to reason within the frames of the literatures of the imagination, where each object has a simple narrative function, like a theater prop, our players end up disoriented by the real just above the surface, by this mask that is only here because the century demands it.

([Te Deum pour un Massacre](http://www.legrog.org/jeux/te-deum-pour-un-massacre) is a game by Jean-Philippe Jaworski taking the player in the France of the [Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre), you probably remember the black-wearing Protestants and the colorful Catholics in the movie [La Reine Margot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TGxdGcNPV0))
