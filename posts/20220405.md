Casus Belli, is the main francophone TTRPG magazine. It started in 1980 and its current iteration is the fourth one.

I received my copy #39 and here are the things in it that caught my attention.

The scenarii (modules) proposed by such a magazine, are what I look at first. What is in? What did they make of it?

* "The riverbed may be dry..." for [Dune](https://www.modiphius.net/pages/discover-dune-roleplaying-game)
* "Flowers for Alderon" for [Land of Arran / COF](https://www.black-book-editions.fr/catalogue.php?id=712)
* "Milwaukee 1991" for [Modern CO](https://www.black-book-editions.fr/catalogue.php?id=479)

"COF" and "Modern CO" are "Chroniques Oubli√©es" declensions. I have never tried it, I think it's a fork of 3.5 D&D. That [Black Book Editions](https://www.black-book-editions.fr/), the current publisher of _Casus Belli_ uses to power various worlds.

That's only three scenarii, while Casus #38 has five of them. It's probably due to the issue containing two full games:

* "Like Ulysse" a game about maritime adventures
* "Les Artilleuses" a solo game about a 1910 Paris with flying cats and other faeries, it's based on a [comic](https://www.google.com/search?q=les+artilleuses&source=lnms&tbm=isch) that looks very good

The reviews that interested me were:

* "Dune"
* "Dungeon Crawl Classics", french edition
* ["Logos"](http://www.magiverse.net/), a beautiful-looking game
* "Trudvang Snow Saga"

I was very happy to see "Yami Monogatari" and "Sakura no Densetsu", two supplements to [L'Empire des Cerisiers](20210225.html?t=L_Empire_des_Cerisiers&f=cb39) getting reviewed as well.

[Game Wizards](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/game-wizards) is presented, and there is also an interview of Jon Peterson, its author.

Casus Belli has been proposing a medieval urban setting named Laelith since 1985. This CB 39 has a surprise, it proposes ways to adapt Laelith to Shadowrun.

There is "True Sith Order" faction for Star Wars. I can't say much about it, I avoid anything Star Wars.

I am a bit disappointed by this issue. I need to take a second look at the scenario "Flowers of Alderon" and at the "Ulysse" game. The two articles around Jon Peterson are nice, I hope they will review "The Elusive Shift" at some point.
