"Eow" for [End Of Week](/#eow). TTRPG Links I gathered during the week. This is iteration 45.

For more weekly links, head to The Seed of Worlds [Shiny TTRPG link collection](https://seedofworlds.blogspot.com/search/label/weekly%20links). There are also Ruprecht's [Best of the Web](https://ruprechtsrpg.blogspot.com/search/label/Best%20of%20the%20Web), and [The Indie RPG Newsletter](https://ttrpg.substack.com/) with its weekly links.

Now in a quarantine hotel, using my suitcase as a desk for my laptop. Still in a no images and no comments mode. My favourite post is [On running large open table games](https://seedofworlds.blogspot.com/2021/11/on-running-large-open-table-games.html).

<hr/>

[Engine Overview: The Mark of the Odd](https://deathtrap-games.blogspot.com/2021/11/engine-overview-mrk-of-odd.html)

> Overall, play in a Mark of the Odd game is focused on problem solving and creativity. Combat is lethal even for a relatively high level characters against relatively weak opponents. Instead, player characters must always focus on finding ways to stack advantages.

[My Top 5 OSR and Non-OSR Indie RPG Roundup](https://deathtrap-games.blogspot.com/2021/11/night-while-chatting-with-my-wife-whos.html)

> It is about using the open source language of Basic /Expert or Advanced D&D to create something different. Thus, my favorite OSR games both are familiar, on some levels, and totally new on others.

<hr/>

[Coins in D&D and Found Advancement](https://lichvanwinkle.blogspot.com/2021/11/coins-in-d-and-found-advancement.html)

> In D&D, then, coins are not really coins. They are vague, shiny rewards, findable units of experience.

<hr/>

[On running large open table games](https://seedofworlds.blogspot.com/2021/11/on-running-large-open-table-games.html)

> Nowadays we might call it an overly elongated funnel - a bunch of randomly generated characters thrown into hazard together until eventually out the far side a group of unlikely companions emerges.

<hr/>

[The Tension between Armour Class and Hit Points](https://merricb.com/2021/11/03/the-tension-between-armour-class-and-hit-points/)

> There were two primary ways of avoiding death. You could stand behind the front line so that no one could attack you in melee. Or you could have a good armour class, so monsters were unlikely to hit you.

<hr/>

[Effects of Armor Class on Character Longevity](https://chiquitafajita.blogspot.com/2021/11/effects-of-armor-class-on-character.html)

> It seems to me that the purpose of the to-hit roll is not just to prolong the lifespan of the target but, literally and directly, to introduce the likelihood that a hit fails altogether. That sounds obvious, but it's a distinction worth drawing out with different implications for play than simply increasing hit points.

<hr/>

[Hex-crawls: A Simple Guide](https://beyondfomalhaut.blogspot.com/2021/11/blog-hex-crawls-simple-guide.html)

> Irony: no longer just a diet rich in ferrous metals. Old-school gaming is now officially old, having lasted way longer than the period of gaming it looks back on.

> The basic hex-crawl, in comparison, is dirt simple to understand, design, and run. Hence, this post.

<hr/>

[AD&D1e: Hex on up](https://www.thevikinghatgm.com/2020/12/hex-on-up.html)

> This is the procedure. As always, don't worry if the results are weird - "How can the knight be lawful evil and his wife chaotic good?" because the dice are always right. Roll it up now, make sense of it later.

<hr/>

[The Poltergeist of Furze House](https://www.moltensulfur.com/post/the-poltergeist-of-furze-house)

> The ghost of the late Mr. Furze urged Fry to buy a ring with the money and give the old woman the ring instead. She accepted it. All’s well that ends well, right?

<hr/>

[It all boils down to… that thing the good professor invented](https://darkwormcolt.wordpress.com/2021/11/01/it-all-boils-down-to-that-thing-the-good-professor-invented/)

> We both roll dice. If you roll high, your view of reality prevails. If I roll high, my view of reality prevails. If we're close, we negotiate.

<hr/>

["We're Doing Something Wrong."](https://grognardia.blogspot.com/2021/11/were-doing-something-wrong.html)

> I well recall playing a game of Cold War fighter combat (...) in the early 80s where a single pass by two Tornados at an element of MIG 25s that might have taken ten to thirty seconds of real time actually required all afternoon to play.

<hr/>

[The Basic Procedure of the OSR](https://www.prismaticwasteland.com/blog/the-universal-procedure-of-the-osr)

> The Basic Procedure, when spelled out, almost reads like a story game, with the idea that the game is a conversation and the rules intervene in and mediate that conversation, imposing some sort of structure.

<hr/>

[The DM is a Shut Eye](https://inplacesdeep.blogspot.com/2021/11/the-dm-is-shut-eye.html)

> However, like the shut eye, the trick works best if the dungeon master is practicing a self delusion. All of us do this to a degree, because it is necessary to the very act of imagining.

<hr/>

[The Landlord/Monopoly Game](https://deltasdnd.blogspot.com/2021/11/the-landlordmonopoly-game.html)

> Ethan Mollick, Professor of Management at the Wharton Business School, gave us a great reminder that the game of Monopoly was, ironically, ripped off from a prior game with partly similar mechanics and a totally different intent

<hr/>

[Normal Men, Sorcery, and Alignment](https://melancholiesandmirth.blogspot.com/2021/10/normal-men-sorcery-and-alignment.html)

> 1) Alignment is not a mere philosophy but indicates allegiance to supernatural forces;
> 2) Human Characters start off as Neutral and become Lawful or Chaotic through the course of a campaign;
> 3) Magic is either granted or stolen from Demons of Chaos.

(fr) [1982 : Donjons et Dragons aux Editions Solar, traduction ou plagiat ?](http://la-forge-de-papier.over-blog.com/2021/11/1982-donjons-et-dragons-aux-editions-solar-traduction-ou-plagiat.html)

In 1982, a lavish "Donjons et Dragons" was published in France, while there were no official traductions. The post asks itself if this was a translation or a plagiarism. Probably neither. Anyways copies of the book now fetch high prices.
