_Accuracy_, _Avoidance_, _Mitigation_, and _Endurance_ are the four terms that Jon Peterson chose to categorize the combat systems in [Playing at the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15784870-playing-at-the-world) (yes, it's not the first time I write [about this book](/#patw)).

It's at this point in the book where [Tony Bath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Bath)'s 1966 Medieval rules flow into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Geneva_Tactical_Studies_Association" title="Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association">LGTSA</a> medieval miniature rules, into Chainmail, and then into Dungeons & Dragons.

Here are the four terms and how they manifest in Dungeons & Dragons:

> **Accuracy** is a good term for the offensive property of which _Avoidance_ is the opposing defensive corollary.

The To Hit roll.

> **Avoidance** systems in wargames are mechanisms in which a unit has a quantified, probabilistic resistance to being hit.

The Armor Class, reducing the chance of a hit.

> **Mitigation**, that is the partial or complete nullification, of damage that would be dealt to a character

The Saving Throws are a mitigation mechanism for damage occurring without an accuracy check for the attacker.

> By rejecting the prior atomicity of units, Reiswitz inaugurated a tradition of **Endurance** in wargaming, systems wherein a unit can sustain quantitative damage — which Reiswitz referred to by the English word "points" — without being destroyed

The Hit Points. Contrast that with Chess, the ur wargame where unit status is binary.

A quick side note: as a francophone player, when I was a kid, we said "Points de Vie" (Life Points) in my neck of the woods, we didn't say "Points de Coup" (Hit Points) and that was a bit unfortunate because it was colouring our perception of the concept.

&nbsp;

> As these concepts are critical for understanding the design of Dungeons & Dragons, note that _mitigation_ and _endurance_ systems are completely orthogonal to how hits are determined. _Mitigation_ takes place after an _accuracy_ or _avoidance_ check (if any, as in the spellcasting case in Dungeons & Dragons there is none) has already occurred, only when the resulting damage is absorbed in whole or in part.
>
> Failing to hit a target altogether (typically because of the poor outcome fo a "to-hit" roll) results in a similar lack of damage, but that must be considered separately as _avoidance_ from the perspective of system design.
>
> Confusingly, _mitigation_ and _endurance_ in different systems might be intended to model the same property of the "real" world — the rationalization for withstanding damage is, however, also separable from the manner in which its behavior is systematized in a game. Furthermore, when they do model different properties, _endurance_ and _mitigation_ are not mutually exclusive. While they serve similar purposes (forestalling the loss of units), they are sometimes employed concurrently, or to be more precise, serially.

&nbsp;

In 2021, I wrote about First Legends' [combat aspect](20210524.html?t=First_Legends_Combat&f=Accuracy_Avoidance_Mitigation_Endurance). In that french game, **Accuracy** is provided by a skill check (club, ace, mace), the adversary may choose to exercise **Avoidance** and do a Dodge skill check (nullifying a successful hit) or to exercise **Mitigation** with a Parry skill check (whose success margin reduces the damage points incurred). Finally there is passive **Mitigation** with the armor absorbing some or all of the remaining damage points. **Endurance**, finally is provided by Strain Points (Physical * 2 + Mental).

Thus, beyond understanding the design of Dungeon & Dragons, I think these concepts are a useful tool for designing and/or evaluating combat systems. It might even be useful when looking at social combat systems.

&nbsp;

And a last quote for Dungeons & Dragons and its level scale:

> At higher level, therefore, the system relies increasingly on _endurance_ to guard against precipitous deaths.
