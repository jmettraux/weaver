## Overstay

You've seen it coming. The smile of the lady of the place is gone. It's been one week since your party's wounded horse got healed. Still, the host is cheerful as ever when it's time for drinks and stories.

But this morning, he sent for you to join him on his morning walk. You've seen the lady with her hard eyes on her husband as he adjusted his coat and joined you and his other clients to head together outside of the fence.

"I have something to request from you".
