Here is a set of rules for setting up a camp and resting. They were initially part of the free extension to [Gallant &amp; Bold](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/316192/Gallant--Bold) named "Sur la Route" (On the Road). Gallant &amp; Bold is a "Vieille École" medieval fantasy game that I [reviewed](20210514.html?f=camping&t=Gallant_And_Bold) a few months ago.

Since those rules were [released freely](https://www.patreon.com/posts/sur-la-route-42161667) last year, I endeavour to translate them to english here. I only do it for the bivouac rules. The free extension also contains a 6 x 12 travel event table but I prefer to focus on the camp aspect of travel.

The free extension was later included in the Gallant &amp; Bold [Compagnon 2](https://www.lulu.com/search?adult_audience_rating=00&page=1&pageSize=10&q=vaillants+compagnon+2) book.

Please note that Gallant &amp; Bold uses 3d6 to determine attributes but considers 3 as the best score and 18 as the worse. When it is written "check against your Wisdom", it means roll a d20 and if it's equal or greater than your Wisdom score, you succeed.

## To Camp

The following mechanisms complete and replace the camp rules found in Gallant &amp; Bold, by adding several interesting options.

When the evening comes, adventuring may do a check against their Intelligence or their Wisdom, adding their _Scout_ bonus. It's a group action. Given the results, the players may chose the type of camp they set up.

* if everybody succeeds, the players may choose three qualifiers;
* if more than half the players succeed, choose two qualifiers;
* if at least one success, choose one qualifier;
* no successes, no qualifiers;
* each natural 20 grants one more qualitifier;
* each natural 1 removes one qualifier

Here are the qualifiers:

**Comfortable** · The camp is organized for the wounded to rest quietly. The adventurers regain all their hit points in the morning. A camp that is not _comfortable_ only grants half the missing hit points.

**Functional** · The camp lets adventurers perform certain training or maintenance tasks (see list below). A camp that is not _functional_ only lets adventurers gaze at the stars, and then hopefully, sleep.

**Meditative** · The camp was set up in a place that favours introspection, reflection, and praying. The next day, each adventurer benefits from an extra adventure point.

**Nourishing** · The camp surroundings are particulary well-provided, foraging is easy. Adventurers don't need to tap into their rations tonight, everything is at hand.

**Secure** · The camp is set up discreetly. Keeping watch is probably still necessary but it should be safe. Somehow.

&nbsp;

When the camp is _functional_, the adventurers may learn their spells, maintain weapons and armor, study books or objects, etc. They may each perform one of the following tasks:

**Workout** · The adventurer does their reps of push-ups, squats, etc. Check against Strength, in case of success, +1d4 damage in melee the next day.

**Training** · The adventurer does their adventurer training. Trace a bar near the XP box on the character sheet. A soon as the bar count reaches the Intelligence score, erase them and add one XP point.

**Herbalism** · The adventurer sorts and prepares the herbs they gathered during the day of travel. That provides him a dose of _common herbs_ (see page 10 of the [first Compagnon](https://www.lulu.com/search?adult_audience_rating=00&page=1&pageSize=10&q=vaillants+compagnon)). If rarer herbs are necessary, the adventurer must succeeds a check against Wisdom. If they want the rarest herbs, they check with disadvantage.

**Alchemy** · The adventurer prepares a common potion during the evening. For rarer potions, they must succeed a check against their Dexterity. The rarest potions require a check with disadvantage.

**Sleep** · The adventurer enjoys a good night of sleep. The next days he benefits from 1d8 extra temporary hit points. If they succeed a check against Constitution, they benefit from 1d8 extra temporary hit points per short rest.

**Spiritism** · The adventurer communicates with the surrounding nature spirits. If they succeed a Charisma check, they obtain information about the next day's road, possible shortcuts, interesting things to do in the surroundings. The player may ask three questions to the referee.
