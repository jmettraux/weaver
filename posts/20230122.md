"Eow" for [End Of Week](/#eow). TTRPG Links I gathered during the week. This is not iteration 108.

For more weekly links, head to The Seed of Worlds [Shiny TTRPG link collection](https://seedofworlds.blogspot.com/search/label/weekly%20links).

Most of the links below are found via the [RPG Planet](https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/) that Alex Schroeder built and maintains. If you have a TTRPG blog, please consider [joining the conversation](https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Planet/Please_join!).

I have to focus on other things, I am putting the "End of Week" links on pause.

About the OGL? Others already explained to us that the trolls tunnelled out of the dungeon long before.
