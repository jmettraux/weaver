"Eow" for "End Of Week". Links I gathered during the week. This is iteration 4.

[Thoughts about combat rounds in OD&D](https://betola.de/wandererbill/english/thoughts-about-combat-rounds-in-odd/)

> Order of actions should not only depend on random die rolls but just as well on tactical decisions made by the players.

And [A refinement to the ubiquitous initative procedure](https://takeonrules.com/2020/12/31/a-refinement-to-the-ubiquitous-initiative-procedure/)

> My design intention for _Declared Initiative Procedure_ is to highlight the chaos, danger, and desperation of combat.

I really like the mechanism Jeremy is proposing. I'll try to use it in my next game.

[Age of D&D new joiners jumped ~5 yrs since 2015](https://seedofworlds.blogspot.com/2021/01/age-of-d-new-joiners-jumped-5-yrs-since.html)

> Taken together this points toward a significant shift in who is coming to the game in recent years, with change accelerating since 2015. In 2000-2010 it was still 80% of people joining as a teenager. Since 2015 70% who join are adults. How come this huge switch has happened? I knew there had been a massive influx of new people since 2015 so I expected a change, certainly, but so fast and so far?

[The Origins of Rule Zero](https://playingattheworld.blogspot.com/2021/01/the-origins-of-rule-zero.html)

> The idea that a gamemaster has the discretion to alter or discard published rules was not an invention of role-playing games: it derived from a wargaming tradition going back to the free Kriegsspiel of the nineteenth century. But role-players enshrined it as a principle that is today known as "Rule Zero"
