## Grognard

Each time the excellent Professor Dungeonmaster says [Grognard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=432&v=cf8LhRDMHyA) it hurts. Grognard is a french term lifted by wargamers. It means the [Grumblers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Guard_(France)#Les_Grognards).

This is how "Grognard" is pronounced:

Else, to us francophones, it sounds closer to [goguenard](https://translate.google.com/?sl=fr&tl=en&text=goguenard&op=translate), but maybe that's exactly what you want, "goguenard" meaning "mocking", or "sly".

By the way, this is how "Coup de Gr√¢ce" is pronounced:

<audio controls src="docs/20210107_coup_de_grace.mp3"></audio>

If you stop before the final "ce", it sounds like "coup de gras" which means something more akin to "getting suddenly fat", not the "final blow" you mean.

Thanks.
