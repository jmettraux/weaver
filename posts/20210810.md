## Ambibosta Ritual

I am still reeling from reading Jean-Philippe Jaworski "MÃªme pas Mort" and ["Chasse Royale"](20210802.html?t=Chasse_Royale&f=Ambibosta). It is excellent and I am looking forward to read the rest of the story.

In this post I translate two descriptions of the "ambibosta" oneiric divination technique known to the Celts.

The first description in the book comes from a Druid attempting to use it as he has access to choice meat in a banquet:

> During the banquet, I used a powerful magical technique. I chewed the red meat and spat it back, offering it to the gods; I lied with the palms of my hands covering my face. But three full nights are necessary for the ambibosta ritual to grant a clear vision, alas, the scouts came back shortly after my eyes had closed. My dreams were interrupted. What I saw was so incomplete that I cannot derive a sure oracle from it... A pack of dogs encircled by fire... A chariot emerging from a river... A boar and a bear avoiding their duel... The farewells of two huge ravens perched on weapon trophees. I did not sleep enough to unravel the meaning of it all.

Later in the book, it's a precocious child who attempts it:

> Sacrila, after having well chewed her portion of bacon, spits it back on the flat stone she had prepared.
> <br/>- If it's not to her majesty's taste, there are others who are hungry here, growls Drucco.
> <br/>- I too am hungry, retorts the young girl, but we have to keep the gods' part.
> <br/>- You think the gods will appreciate your vomit?
> <br/>- It's a magic trick, you idiot. I have to eat the same meat as they do, to see through their eyes.
> <br/>Labrios starts to understand what is going on, and he exclaims:
> <br/>- But, do tell me, that's a divination ritual! Only the druids have the talent and the right to perform it.
> <br/>- Yes, so what?
> <br/>- So you are about to commit a dangerous sacrilege.
> <br/>- Right away, the big words.
> <br/>(...)
> <br/>Sacrila:
> <br/>- Someone is necessary to keep watch on the augury's sleep. If you're interrupted in the vision, the revelation can be lost or completely misunderstood.
> <br/>(...)
> <br/>- Furthermore, I don't really remember the ambibosta formulas. I had to improvise. Maybe it will lead to surprises...
> <br/>- You didn't follow the ritual? If you can't remember the formulas, how could it work?
> <br/>- Instead I sang something I learnt in Aballo. Anyway, the enchantments of Prittuse are as powerful as the druids' incantations. It should be okay.
> <br/>- What? You have tinkered with your spell?
> <br/>- Shut up Bellovese, I won't have any visions if you won't let me sleep.

I couldn't find information about this "Ambibosta" ritual outside of Jaworski's work. It seems the word itself means "joined with both hands" and was also a unit of measure. It would match the two palms placed on the face of the caster "somatic component".

I saw a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OtqsZ_m_Cc) of Jean-Philippe Jaworski where he mentioned in passing that he had based the ritual on a description that had percolated into medieval irish literature.

Sacrila's ritual yielded the expected three nights of dream, _memory_, _heart_, and _soul_. Chewing the meat, singing the incantation and joining the palms to the face, all this seems easy. Interpreting the three dreams is probably the hardest part.
