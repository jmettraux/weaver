## Beers and Dragons session zero

Sometimes around AD 890 in the lands north of Jorvik, two saxon teenagers, Oswald a jack of all trades and Gerald, a would be fighter, were having a good time with their girlfriends. It would have been a most fine time, if one of the girl's little sister weren't throwing stones at the couples and sermoning them about not getting lured by the two boys.

At some point, the little girl stopped bothering the couples. All was fine under the late morning May sun, until screams were heard. "My little sister" gasped a girl. Oswald and Gerald stood up, retied their pants and got closer to the small ridge behind which the little girl was, a few minutes ago.

The little sister, gagged and tied to a perch, was heaved like a captured boar on the shoulder of four creatures. Pointy ears, pointy tooth, green skin and grinning, they looked really happy at their find. Wielding short bows, were two or three guards, covering all angles around the transport party. The girl secured, they left westwards.

"They got my little sister, I'm going to tell my father" and she ran for the fields the villagers were busy preparing. Oswald and Gerald, left alone by the two girls are a bit mystified. Their grandmothers had told them about goblins, but they had never seen any of them. "Gerald, I have trouble spotting them, I set my eyes on one of them, then try to locate the second one, and the first one is gone in the greenery". "Same for me, they are gone".
