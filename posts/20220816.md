## Ability and Roll High

Back in the days, when I moved from [First Legends](20210520.html?t=Premieres_Legendes&f=roll_high) to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, I liked the directness of rolling 3d6 (we probably rolled best 3 of 4d6 then), but going from a system of additions flowing gracefully into a skill system, to a serie of six tables with each its own logic, it felt off.

The conviction that AD&D was the superior form of the game soon drowned the feeling. And the Monster Manual was a cornucopia of inspiration, the source of hours of reverie. First Legends bestiary felt meager.

It's now 2022, the time I have left for dreaming has shrinked dramatically. I want less rules and I want to piggyback the "roll 1d20 ≥ DC" and "no armor is AC 10" systems.

[Gallant & Bold](20210514.html?t=Gallant_And_Bold&f=roll_high) put abilities on their heads and says, 3 is the best, not 18, since you roll 1d20 high, with 3 you are very strong, you roll 1d20 ≥ 3 to succeed a check about strength. It seemed that while being appreciated for its elegance and its beauty, Gallant and Bold players were complaining, longing for ability scores pointing back towards 18.

I thought that it was very simple to roll the abilities high as usual and then simply compute the corresponding "y = 21 - x". It slows down a little bit the character creation, but players feel good comparing their above 12 scores, and the "roll high against y" shines, just a few centimeters away.

If a subtraction is a scary thing, it's easy to turn the exercise into a small table lookup, as seen on the left side. If you rolled a 6 for Strength, you have to roll 15 or better to succeed in a strength feat, likewise, if you rolled 15, the corresponding "DC" is 6.

I was happy to have 2 × 6 ability scores on the character sheets for my table [rules](https://github.com/jmettraux/aachen). This business of having "low" ability leveraged as DC was intriguing. The greater the AC the better, the smaller the DC the better, both directions have a use in a 1d20 roll high context.

When challenging yourself, you roll against the low number, when opposing an enemy action, the offender rolls against your high number.

For now, I labelled the high number "DC" and the low number "TC". I chose the mnemonic Defend / Transcend. I also chose a lozenge, close to the shield symbol used for AC. so lozenge and shield, DC and AC when defending, while a simple circle and TC when transcending oneself.

This is the core of my Aachen system, it goes [further](images/20220816_abilities.png) but the opposition DC and TC provides the referee with target numbers for rolls. The skill levels come later and they're simply modifiers to the rolls.
