I wrote last week about [Muses and Oracles](20220415.html?f=dark_wood_tarot&t=Oblique_and_Oracles), this time, I found the [Dark Wood Tarot](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Wood-Tarot-Sasha-Graham/dp/0738759309) by Sasha Graham and illustrated by [Abigail Larson](https://abigaillarson.com/).

It comes as magnet locked box flagged "Body, Mind & Spirit / Tarot". The box contains a book and the deck of cards. I do not know if I will keep the book, since I just need the cards, as muses, and those muses are beautiful.

The troll under the bridge is an excellent take on the Four of Wands. I like how its hand splits the flow.
