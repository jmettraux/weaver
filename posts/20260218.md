## Rogue Trader

My Trench+Crusade terrain, although unfinished found its way to the tabletop. Devilish hordes did not stampede it, Space Marines and imperial troops confronted thugs and criminal hobbyists over it.

[Mutazoid](https://talesfromthecantwarasector.blogspot.com/) proposed we play a game of Rogue Trader, the first edition of Warhammer 40 000. I said yes.

Rogue Trader was published in 1987, I remember riding the train to Geneva with my friend Dennis to explore a game shop there. The main piece of loot was a copy of Rogue Trader, probably the first printing. I was a bit torn, because my level of English was insufficient at that point, but I bought the book anyway, because it was and still is an awesome gaming artefact. But what had I acquired?

In my foggy understanding of the thing, it was a skirmish game that could be used as a role-playing game. The lore was thick, dark, and felt like a hall where all kinds of guests could gather, and stories be told, and games played.

There was "Rogue Trader" on the cover, the concept was described in the book. But the Space Marines stole it all, supported by the Emperor. A trading stub of a rogue, but at no point would I feel cheated. Much meat on the many bones.

I had purchased eight beaky lead Space Marines. We cooked up a scenario, Marines vs Xenos in a cave complex, and that was it. The only game I played. I still have the book. Its spine is weaker, I had lent it to a graphical designer friend who avidly photocopied pieces of art out of it. He was not a gamer, but he certainly enthused over the cornucopia.

Maybe it was a bit too grim, my deciphering leading me to understand the toll exacted by the emperor, or maybe I didn't want to buy and paint miniatures, at that point I became more interested into hex and counter wargames. Why did I say yes in 2026? Because I'm back to miniature gaming thanks to Gary and Mutazoid.

In the grim darkness of far future there is only war. I'd much prefer leading a cavalry charge to elysian fields after having coordinated my center and my wings, on a beautiful summer day. Ancients, knights, balearic slingers and grassy green.

I said yes, because I wanted to experience the game under the guidance of a veteran and see, technically, what it is about. If I'm to play its grandsons Trench+Crusade and Konflikt'47, I need a grasp on Rogue Trader, a point of reference, a beacon.

Mutazoid described our first game in [a post](https://talesfromthecantwarasector.blogspot.com/2026/02/tussle-at-townwall-two-player-game-of.html). I lost to the blue-skinned Xenos who stole some piece of hardware after hacking one or two of my squads with following fire.

Oh well, I felt like a deer caught in the headlights. How could I hit the ground and fire back? How to flank? Am I supposed to run by four inches increments towards death? Here is my charge into Elysium.

I felt like I had the words but not the grammar to weave sentences. I wanted to says "fix and flank", but could only utter "move and fire". The second game, yesterday evening, went better. Our sessions are turning into a campaign, so I'd better revise weapons and ranges, consider the terrain and reserve moves.

Mutazoid mentioned that there is an "Overwatch" rule, `Remain on alert and fire during the opponent’s turn if a target appears` says the AI, what page do I ask, "page 30", well, I don't see it there, I can't seem to find it, in the whole book, but what a trip down memory lane, what a piece of lore. No, I did not see any illustration of any Space Marine taking cover. I remembered Mutazoid saying something like "the ruleset has its origins in Napoleonics, lines of men standing and firing". Please give me french columns slamming into those lines... Vive l'Empereur!

Very grateful to my friend for having brought all his miniatures, having prepared a scenario (now turning into a campaign) and teaching me the rules. I'm looking forward to the third session. (Also kudos to Gary for having restored a Space Hulk set, I need to write about those sessions too).
