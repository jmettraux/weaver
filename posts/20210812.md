## Trusting the Referee

I remember being told something along the line of "in our group, we track monster hit points in the open, so that the gamemaster cannot cheat".

I wanted to ask "so you don't trust your gamemaster?" or to pontificate by uttering "your gaming group is so broken, it doesn't trust its gamemasters".

And then I told to myself: "this person is way more experienced as a referee and as a player than I am, I will shut up, shelve that piece of information, and weave my web until the piece can be used again".

I should not have shut up, I should have asked: "What kind of dishonesty gave rise to this policy at your table? What kind of referee dishonesty are you trying to prevent?"
