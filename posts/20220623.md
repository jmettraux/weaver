I was looking for a copy of Björn Landström's book [The Ship](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1193880.The_Ship) and I came across an edition of [The Kalevala](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/319445.The_Kalevala?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=ZvPvUo3Qoy&rank=1) that he illustrated.

> I am wanting, I am thinking<br/>
> To arise and go forth singing,<br/>
> Sing my songs and say my sayings,<br/>
> Hymns ancestral harmonizing,<br/>
> Lore of kindred lyricking.<br/>
> In my mouth the words are melting;<br/>
> Utterances overflowing<br/>
> To my tongue are hurrying,<br/>
> Even against my teeth they burst.

> Come good brother, little brother,<br/>
> Pretty playmate of my childhood,<br/>
> Start now with me for the singing<br/>
> Sit together for the speaking,<br/>
> Now that we have met together,<br/>
> After separate pathways travelled;<br/>
> Seldom do we come together,<br/>
> Rarely do we have each other<br/>
> In these ragged border regions,<br/>
> These benighted northern marches.

> Strike we now hand into hand,<br/>
> Fingers into curve of fingers,<br/>
> So that we may sing good songs,<br/>
> Voice the best of all our legends<br/>
> For the hearing of our loved ones,<br/>
> Those who want to learn them from us,<br/>
> Those among the rising young ones<br/>
> Of the growing generation.<br/>
> Magic verses we have gathered,<br/>
> Kindled by the inspiration<br/>
> From the belt of Väinämöinen,<br/>
> Under forge of Ilmarinen,<br/>
> Sword blade of the man far-minded,<br/>
> Aim of Joukahainen's crossbow,<br/>
> From the way-back fields of Northland,<br/>
> From the heaths of Kalevala.
